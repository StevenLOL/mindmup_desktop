Here is an outdated app, the mindmup desktop version (offline) for chrome browser. 0.0.0.14_0

To install, from your chrome, load this folder by  setting|extensions|load unpacked extension.


This APP is from Google Play Store. After Google removed this from their store, I recovered this APP from my old computer's [Chrome's browser](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14543896/where-does-chrome-store-extensions). The folder _metadata folder is removed so you can install it from local file system.
