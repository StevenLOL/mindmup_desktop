Here is an outdated app, the [mindmup](https://github.com/mindmup/legacy-mindmup) desktop version 0.0.0.14_0 (offline) for chrome/chromium browser. 

To install, from your chrome, load this folder by  setting|extensions|load unpacked extension.


This APP is from Google Play Store. After Google removed this from their store, I recovered these files from my old computer's [Chromium's browser](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14543896/where-does-chrome-store-extensions). The folder _metadata is removed, so you can install it from local file system.


# open mindmup file in other mindmap applications
